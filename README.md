# **Escape the Dungeon**

# **Introduction**
Escape the Dungeon is a text-based adventure game where the player has to try and escape the dungeon. 

There are several different rooms that the player must go through and complete before getting to the boss room to defeat the final boss.

The game is purely terminal based, however in the future, I would like to add animation and sound features to the game.

In this document I will discuss some of my comments about the game as well as where I got my inspirations from to create a text-based game, as well as some thoughts I had on using Python for the first time. I will also discuss the creation of the map and function breakdown, using LucidChart.

Furthermore, I will go into the features and gameplay aspects of the game, as well as features that I intend to implement in the future. 

I will finally go through the testing I done for the game, as well as the method I had used to deploy the game so that it was live.

## **Creators Comments**
Within this section I will go into detail about my reasons why I decided to create a text-based adventure game, where I got my inspirations from and my thoughts on using Python.
### ***Reasons Behind the Game***
I have always been a bit of a gamer and enjoyed playing different types of games. Even when I was younger I remember playing several text-based games that I owned or that were online. It was definetly a nostalgic past time and I wanted to recreate some of that with this game. 

Playing these adventure games always made me happy and it was always interesting to know the different ending possibilities to get. Although I decided to opt for a more simple version of a text-based adventure game, there are more interactions that would have been interesting to add or create - however I decided to get the main part of the game completed before thinking about anything else more complex.

Before I started writing the code for the game, I planned out document of what I possibly wanted to add in, so I knew what I was going to do. The document served as my basis to start creating the text-based game. I did refer to this document a lot throughout the game when adding 'player', 'enemy', 'health/stamina', and 'damage' stats. I did change some of the ideas when actually implementing the game, however the basis all stayed the same.

All in all I am happy with what I have created and I have had fun playing it.

### ***Inspirations***
A lot of my insirations came from games I have played as a child and growing up. I played a lot of different types of games and different genres - I especially emjoyed playing RPG games though. 

Some games that I took inspiration from:
* Legend of Zelda Series
* Elden Ring
* Hugo's House of Horrors (and the rest of the series)
* The Lifeline series (mobile game)
* Dungeons and Dragons

### ***My thoughts***
Using Python and a text-based terminal was a really fun experience. The text-based terminal really did remind me of vintage and retro games that I used to play online. Python was also a fun language to use to create the code and easy to understand, without having run into many problems and issues.
